/**
 * Wraps cashDisbursementApi with list state + all backend actions.
 * Every mutating action refetches the list on success so the table stays
 * in sync with server-computed fields (outstanding_amount, status, etc —
 * these are never set optimistically since the backend, not the client,
 * owns that math).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this hook manages its own disbursements list via plain state
 * (not react-query), but issue/return/expended/reimburse/editAmount can
 * all change a revolving_fund's balance/status server-side — including
 * auto-clearing a CLOSED fund to CLEARED once its last disbursement is
 * settled (see cashDisbursementController.js). The Revolving Funds page
 * reads funds through react-query (`useRevolvingFunds`, key
 * ['revolvingFunds']), which has no way to know that data went stale from
 * a mutation made through THIS hook. Every mutation below therefore also
 * invalidates that query cache, or the fund list silently shows stale
 * statuses/balances until the user manually retries or remounts the page.
