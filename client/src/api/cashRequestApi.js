/**
 * Thin wrapper around /cash-request, mirroring cashDisbursementApi.js's
 * conventions exactly (same apiClient import, same getAll/action shape).
 * Endpoints match cash-request.routes.js 1:1:
 *   GET  /cash-request
 *   GET  /cash-request/activity
 *   POST /cash-request
 *   PUT  /cash-request/update
 *   PUT  /cash-request/approve
 *   PUT  /cash-request/reject
 *   PUT  /cash-request/complete
 *
 * `update` requires the backend's PUT /cash-request/update route
 * (updateCashRequest controller) — added specifically so a Requester can
 * edit + resubmit a PENDING or REJECTED request. It does NOT exist for
 * APPROVED/COMPLETED requests; the backend enforces that, this is just
 * the transport.
