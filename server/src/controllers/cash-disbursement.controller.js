 *              revolving fund (issued/outstanding/balance/status), and —
 *              if that fund is linked to a Budget — the budget itself.
 *
 *              The recalculation is ALWAYS based on the DIFFERENCE
 *              (new_amount - old_amount), never the new amount treated as
 *              a fresh transaction:
 *                difference > 0 (increase) -> additional amount is
 *                  deducted from the fund's balance (and the budget, if
 *                  connected) — same direction as a fresh issue.
 *                difference < 0 (decrease) -> the difference is released
 *                  back to the fund's balance (and the budget, if
 *                  connected) — same direction as a return.
 *                difference === 0 -> no financial records are touched.
 *
 *              Lifecycle: only disbursements that are NOT already
 *              LIQUIDATED can have their amount edited (mirrors the
 *              existing UI rule in disbursementColumns.jsx, which disables
 *              the Edit action once status === 'LIQUIDATED') — a fully
 *              settled disbursement is treated as immutable, matching how
 *              this controller already treats CLOSED revolving funds and
 *              budgets as immutable elsewhere.
 *
 *              Fund status guard: an INCREASE pulls new cash out of the
 *              fund, so it's blocked under the same NON_ISSUABLE_RF_STATUSES
 *              rule as a fresh issue (CLOSED/CLEARED/RETURN). A DECREASE
 *              releases cash back, which — like returnCashDisbursement
 *              settling an existing AR — is allowed even against a CLOSED
 *              fund, and can itself trigger that fund's CLOSED -> CLEARED
 *              auto-transition via resolveClosedFundStatus if this was its
 *              last remaining unliquidated disbursement.
 *
 *              Budget connection is resolved via the disbursement's
 *              revolving_fund.budget_id — cash_disbursement has no direct
 *              budget FK of its own. If the fund has no budget_id, only

/**
 * @name returnCashDisbursement
 * @description Record a return of unused issued cash against an existing
 *              disbursement. Does NOT touch budget — money returning to a
 *              fund is a fund-internal move; the budget's balance is only
 *              affected at fund funding/top-up time.
 *
 *              Distinguishes two funds, which may differ:
 *                - ORIGINAL fund (cash_disbursement.revolving_fund_id) —
 *                  the fund the disbursement was CREATED under. This is
 *                  NEVER changed by this function. It owns the AR for this
 *                  disbursement, so its `outstanding`/`liquidated` totals
 *                  are what get settled here, even if it's since gone
 *                  CLOSED (CLOSED alone must never block a liquidation —
 *                  see the status check below, which only ever looks at
 *                  the SELECTED fund). If this settlement brings the
 *                  original fund's outstanding to 0 with nothing else
 *                  UNLIQUIDATED left against it, it auto-advances
 *                  CLOSED -> CLEARED (see resolveClosedFundStatus).
 *                - SELECTED/liquidation fund (`revolving_fund_id` in the
 *                  request body, defaults to the original fund) — the fund
 *                  that actually receives the returned cash. Must be
 *                  OPEN/ON REVIEW; its `returned`/`balance` totals go up,
 *                  and it moves to ON REVIEW as a result of receiving this
 *                  return even if it has never itself issued anything (see
 *                  computeRfStatus's hasActivity contract).
 *
 *              When original and selected are the SAME fund, both effects
 *              land on the same row (identical to the old behavior) — and
 *              since that fund passed the CLOSED check above to get here,
 *              it can never itself be CLOSED at this point, so the normal
 *              computeRfStatus path is always correct for that branch.

 *              Creates a new cash_disbursement row. Cascades to
 *              revolving_fund only (issued↑, amount_expended↑, liquidated↑,
 *              balance↓). Does NOT touch budget, same reasoning as
 *              issueCashDisbursement — the budget was already debited when
 *              this fund was funded/topped-up.
 *
 *              Blocked entirely if the fund is CLOSED, CLEARED, or RETURN —
 *              same guard as issueCashDisbursement, since this is modeled
 *              as a fresh issuance against the fund. The caller selects
 *              which fund to reimburse from via revolving_fund_id, so — same
 *              as returnCashDisbursement — this can be redirected to a
